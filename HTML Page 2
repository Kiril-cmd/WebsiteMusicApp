<!-- Description of the App -->
<h2>Our vision...</h2>
<p>We want to create a platform, where amateur artists can share their music and listen to the creations of other artists.
After a quick registration with a username and an e-mail address, they can start browsing in a library of different genres of music.
Also they are able to upload their own creations and choose in which genre they see themselves. While browsing,
they are able to like and only like the music of others. There will be no comment section, as a protection for the artists,
so they can't be negatively influenced. 
Whenever a song is liked by another user, the creator of this song is being notified by e-mail,
that way the creator can check out who liked his song and has the opportunity to listen to this person's creations.
If the style of music fits his own and he is interested in communicating with this user, he can also like one of the user's songs.
As soon as that happens, a chat-window will open for both of them, where they can share thoughts about each other's music.
When the communication goes well, they can set up a meeting to work together and our service would have been successful.
